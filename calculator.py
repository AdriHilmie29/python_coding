#Write a program to make a simple calculator. The program should perform four basic operations (1-addition, 2-subtraction, 3-multiplication, and 4-division) 
#depending on the userâ€™s choice. 
#The program will take two values from the user and the type of operation. The result will be displayed based on the operation chosen by the user. 
#The program will be repeated until user requests to stop.
